Automated configuration of network devices
First if you want to script work, you need to create file named ip in the root directory. 
Second you need to edit main.py, edit your username & password for ssh and community for snmp. 
I'm usually using two community because first community this is new community, second community is old.
If you don't need second community, community2 leave the field blank.
